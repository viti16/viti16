- 👨‍🔬 I am a researcher PhD candidate in University of Rochester and work in quantum optics, laser-matter interaction etc.
- 👀 I’m interested in how materials change when they are dressed by strong lasers
- 📫 How to reach me viti1606@gmail.com

I upload codes here that I use to solve problems in quantum mechanics.
I am also learning deep learning and meachine learning so I also post projects that I work on.
Feel free to reach out to me.
